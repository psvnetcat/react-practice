# React practice project
This is a practice project created by me, following the principles of declarative programming and
the features of ES6 in JavaScript. For now, the project uses pure React and webpack to work.

## Study book
I'm reading the book Learning React: Functional Web Development with React and Redux by Alex Banks.

## Notes
The file "notes.md" contains the main concepts for me about ES6 features, declarative programming, transpiling
and React components.

## CSS Framework
This project uses Bulma as css framework, to compile a new version you have to execute ````npm run css-build```` wich creates
the App.css file with all the styles.

## Run the app
In order to run the app, you have to type ````yarn start````.
